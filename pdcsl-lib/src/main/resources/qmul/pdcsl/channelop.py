    """Apply an operation set specified as a string.

    This function is a wrapper around the `apply_channel_op` function
    allowing to specify the operations to perform as a single string.

    The `opstring` parameter is a comma-separated list of channel
    operations, each operation being itself a colon-separated pair
    indicating the 1-based index of the source channel and the
    operation to perform.

    Examples `opstring` values:
    - "1:COPY(),1:MASK(MinError),2:MASK(MaxEntropy)"
      The resulting image will have three channels: a direct copy of the
      source image's first channel, then that same channel converted to
      a binary image by the MinError algorithm, then the source image's
      second channel converted to a binary image by the MaxEntropy
      algorithm.
    - "1:APPLY(2),1:APPLY(3)"
      Assuming the source image contains three channels and that the
      last two are binary masks, the resulting image will contain two
      channels, each being the result of the application of one of the
      binary masks on the first channel.

    In addition, the function accepts an optional parameter
    `channel_order` whose purpose is to allow to use a letter code in
    the opstring to identify source channels. For example, if
    `channel_order` is 'RGB', the first example above could be written
    like this:
    - "R:COPY(),R:MASK(MinError),G:MASK(MaxEntropy)"

    The rationale behind this feature is to be able to write opstrings
    that are independent of the order of channels in the source images.
